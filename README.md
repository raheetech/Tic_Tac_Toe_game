Tic Tac Toe Game in Java!!
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Java. The game allows two players to take turns entering their moves on a 3x3 grid until a player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their marker ('X' or 'O'). The game also checks for a tie when the board is full. To play, simply clone the repository and run the Java program. You can take turns making moves by specifying the row and column numbers. The game will display the current state of the board after each move. Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, and customize the game to your liking. Have fun playing Tic Tac Toe!
